# Transformer-based English to Russian Translation with Visualization Tools

## Overview

This project implements a Transformer model from scratch, based on the paper *Attention is All You Need* by Vaswani et al. The model is used for translating text from English to Russian. Additionally, visualization tools are integrated to provide insights into the self-attention and multi-head attention mechanisms within the Transformer architecture.

## Features

- **Transformer Model**: A full implementation of the Transformer architecture, including both the encoder and decoder components.
- **English to Russian Translation**: The model is trained to translate sentences from English to Russian.
- **Attention Visualization**: Integrated tools to visualize the attention weights, including self-attention and multi-head attention mechanisms, helping to understand how the model attends to different parts of the input.
