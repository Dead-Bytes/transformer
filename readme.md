Transformer-based English to Russian Translation with Visualization Tools
Overview
This project implements a Transformer model from scratch, based on the paper Attention is All You Need by Vaswani et al. The model is used for translating text from English to Russian. Additionally, visualization tools are integrated to provide insights into the self-attention and multi-head attention mechanisms within the Transformer architecture.

Features
Transformer Model: A full implementation of the Transformer architecture, including both the encoder and decoder components.
English to Russian Translation: The model is trained to translate sentences from English to Russian.
Attention Visualization: Integrated tools to visualize the attention weights, including self-attention and multi-head attention mechanisms, helping to understand how the model attends to different parts of the input.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
PyTorch 1.9 or higher
Matplotlib (for visualization)
Other dependencies (listed in requirements.txt)
Installation Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/transformer-english-russian.git
cd transformer-english-russian
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Optional) Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Usage
Training the Model
To train the Transformer model on your English-Russian dataset, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --data_dir <path_to_data> --epochs 50 --batch_size 64
You can configure various hyperparameters through the command-line interface. Refer to train.py for all available options.

Translating Text
Once the model is trained, you can use it to translate English sentences to Russian:

bash
Copy code
python translate.py --sentence "Hello, how are you?"
This will output the translated Russian text.

Visualizing Attention
The attention visualization tools allow you to see how the model attends to different parts of the input sequence during translation.

bash
Copy code
python visualize_attention.py --sentence "The cat sat on the mat."
This will generate visual plots showing the attention weights across different layers and heads.

Model Architecture
The Transformer model consists of the following components:

Encoder: Composed of multiple layers of self-attention and feedforward networks.
Decoder: Similar to the encoder but includes additional attention mechanisms to focus on the output of the encoder.
Multi-Head Attention: Allows the model to attend to different positions in the input sequence.
Positional Encoding: Adds positional information to the input embeddings since the Transformer architecture is permutation-invariant.
Attention Visualization
To better understand how the Transformer model works, attention visualizations are crucial. Our visualization tool generates attention maps for both self-attention and multi-head attention layers.

Self-Attention Visualization: Displays how each word in the input sentence attends to other words.
Multi-Head Attention Visualization: Shows the different attention patterns learned by different heads in the multi-head attention mechanism.
